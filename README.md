# ASCIICHANGES

A simple language describing chord progressions (changes) for tunes in ASCII text

# Examples

The simplest well formed program is

<pre>| |</pre>

That is an empty bar. Whitespace is not important. This is equivalent to the previous example:

<pre>||</pre>

As is this one:

<pre>    |   |   </pre>


<pre>| Cm7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 |    |</pre>
